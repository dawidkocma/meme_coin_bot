## Description

BoredApeBot is a real-time price checker for SOL contract coin pairs, developed out of a personal project to make productive use of time. While currently focused on providing live price updates, there's a roadmap to potentially include trading functionalities. This project is perfect for those who want to keep an eye on their investments without the constant need to manually check for price changes.
